# Instructions

To run the bot, create a .env file containing "TOKEN=MY_TOKEN" where MY_TOKEN is your Discord bot token and then run bot.py. To use commands /legendstats and /legendherostats you will need to run get_legend_data.py once (I recommend setting it to run once a day to keep the data up-to-date).
